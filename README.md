# Superstore Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the Superstore dataset, a popular retail sales dataset originally sourced from Tableau's sample data. The dataset contains detailed transactional data including customer orders, product categories, sales, discounts, profits, and shipping information. 

The main goal of this project is to explore and visualize business trends such as sales performance, profitability, customer segmentation, and operational metrics through insightful charts and plots using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- Order information: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode  
- Customer details: Customer ID, Name, Segment, Location (City, State, Region, Postal Code)  
- Product details: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name  
- Sales metrics: Sales amount, Quantity, Discount, Profit/Loss
